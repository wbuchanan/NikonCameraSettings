# Nikon Camera Settings

This is a plugin for NINA that allows users to change a few camera settings from the advanced sequencer.  For cameras that support the functionality, users can change:

1. The location where images are stored:
  - On the disk in the camera only
  - On the computer running NINA only
  - In both locations
2. Changing image stabilization/vibration reduction:
  - Off
  - On _(Note: This setting is dependent on the lens mounted to the camera as well.)_
  - Normal _(Note: This setting is dependent on the lens mounted to the camera as well.)_
  - Sport _(Note: This setting is dependent on the lens mounted to the camera as well.)_
3. Turning the camera monitor on/off:
  - Off
  - On

More settings will be exposed over time.  These were just settings that I wanted to be able to modify for my more immediate needs; _it never hurts to make sure image stabilization is turned off as part of your startup block of your sequence just to be sure it is off_.
