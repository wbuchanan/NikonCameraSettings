CaptureFocusShift:
public const uint FOCUS_SHIFT = 34104;
This returns a struct that isn't very well defined to me at least

GetFocusShiftCaptureInfo:
public const uint FOCUS_SHIFT_INFO = 34108;
Likely has complex return struct.

DiffractionCompensation
public const uint DIFFRACTION_COMPENSATION = 34052;
